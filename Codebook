The following procedures occured in the name-set to making it clearer 

Before Transformation:

tBodyAcc-mean()-X	
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y	
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z	
tBodyAcc-std()-X

After Transformation:

tBodyAcc.mean.Y	
tBodyAcc.mean.Z	
tBodyAcc.std.X	
tBodyAcc.std.Y

means and standard deviations were computed 

The following describes from the basics of the data from the original data set

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
