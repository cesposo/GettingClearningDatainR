# GettingClearningDatainR
Getting and Cleaning Data

The script is a procedural (from top to bottom) R script which is farily simple to execute. Before you run the script, please 
change the directory for the readin table at the top to your directory path for the files that were downloaded for the assignment.

I wrote the code very logically (readins at the top, mergings after that,calculations after that, post-processing formatting 
after that, and finally uploading/write of the complete file)

I run the script line-by-line. Intermediate tables (merged_dat_1 ,2 , etc.) will be established and you can see the step-wise
progression of the initial atoms to the final product.
